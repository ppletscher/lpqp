LPQP FOR MAP INFERENCE
----------------------

This is the code implementing the LPQP algorithms introduced in:

Patrick Pletscher & Sharon Wulff
LPQP for MAP: Putting LP Solvers to Better Use
ICML, 2012.

The code was slightly modified after ICML and hence the results might differ a
bit. We re-tested the grid experiments with this version of the code, and
the results pretty much match the ones in the ICML paper. We did not
re-run the protein & DTF experiments, but would expect roughly the same
results as in the published paper.

The tree-based LPQP weighting is implemented in LPQPSDD, the uniform weighting
in LPQPNPBP.


COMPILATION & INSTALL
---------------------

The software was successfully compiled and tested on Ubuntu 12.04, CentOS 6
and Mac OS X 10.8.

Compilation requires cmake, please make sure you have cmake installed on your
system.

1. create a directory build/
2. run ./fetch_external.sh
3. cd to build
4. run cmake
5. run make install
6. run make test to check whether everything runs as expected

the library and the matlab wrappers are now installed into bin/

To use the wrapper in your own scripts, add the directory containing the
mex_lpqp.mex* to the path within Matlab (using addpath).

Remark: Make sure that the compiler optimizations are turned on (-O3),
otherwise the code is *very* slow (probably has to do with the extensive use
of Eigen).
